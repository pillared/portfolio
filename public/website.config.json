    "details": "I’m a passionate software engineer with a strong focus on backend development, particularly in building enterprise AI platforms and observability solutions. I excel at designing scalable, reliable systems that solve complex problems and drive meaningful business impact. Recently, I’ve expanded my skill set into frontend and fullstack development, enabling me to contribute across the entire stack. I thrive on tackling challenging technical problems with a blend of creativity, precision, and a deep curiosity for emerging technologies. Outside of work, I stay active and inspired through rock climbing, bouldering, skateboarding, mountain biking, and backpacking. I also enjoy driving and immersing myself in music — whether listening, producing, drumming, or playing bass. These passions keep me balanced and fuel my creativity both on and off the keyboard."
